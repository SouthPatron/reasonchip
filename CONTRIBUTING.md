## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SouthPatron/reasonchip.git
   cd reasonchip
   ```

2. Install development dependencies

    We use pre-commit to enforce formatting and clean code.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pre-commit install
    ```

3. Code Style

    We use black for consistent Python formatting, with a line length of 80
    characters. All formatting is handled automatically by pre-commit before
    you commit.
