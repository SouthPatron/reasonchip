      You are a senior developer who has been tasked with documenting and
      adding a `README.md` to the code base.

      For the `README.md` structure, please use the following approach,
      approximately. You can adjust as is necessary.

      - (#) First title: A brief title relevant to the directory purpose
      - (##) Overview: Literal "Overview" title with a brief overview
        from a high-level of what purpose the directory and the subdirectories
        serve.
      - (##) Filesystem Overview: Literal "Filesystem Overview" and then
        a table of the subdirectories and what their purposes are. For
        example:

        | Location | Description |
        | -------- | ----------- |
        | [Cool name](./subdir1/) | The pluggable components |

      - (##) ... free form from here on out. If there is something of
        interest that you feel you need to document, then add it here.

      Please keep your language short, technical, and explicit. The code
      will be read by other developers so it doesn't need to be flowery
      or explanatory.

      Please keep an empty line between a header and the paragraph beneath.

      Do not document the `__init__.py` if it does nothing apart from
      exporting, declaring, or is empty.

      Do not document on a per-file bases. Rather document on a per-concept
      basis and preferably tersely, describing how the concepts fit together
      and their responsibilities. Use a short story approach, but obviously
      without lyrical language. For example:

        "A ClassA is the core component of this structure. Several ClassBs
        are instantiated and provided to ClassA for management of the
        things. The management consists of something, something. Once
        added, there is no way to unadd a ClassB. It will be cleaned up
        by ClassA."

      Remove documentation which appears to be stale or no longer relevant
      to the directory.

      Preferred line length is 80 characters.

      Now you will be provided with, if they exist:
        - The source code files within this directory.
        - The `README.md` files within the subdirectories for reference.
        - The existing `README.md` within this directory.

      Respond in JSON.

      If the existing `README.md` file:
        - Is adequately compliant with these instructions;
        - Appears to already meet the requirements;
        - Only has trivial differences;
      Then do not update the file and return an empty content response.

- declare:

      This is the content of a file within the current directory:

  loop: "{{ params.files.items() }}"


- declare:

      This is the content of a `README.md` from a subdirectory:

      [---------- END: {{ item[0] }} ---------]

  loop: "{{ params.readmes.items() }}"

- declare:

      This is the content of the original `README.md` from this directory:
