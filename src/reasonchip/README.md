# ReasonChip

## Overview

This top-level directory contains the core project components of ReasonChip,
including command line tools, core engine libraries, networking, data, and
utility functionality. It acts as the main namespace and organizational root
for the various subsystems that together implement ReasonChip's pipeline
processing and distributed execution.

## Filesystem Overview

| Location  | Description                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [chipsets](./chipsets/) | Asynchronous pluggable command implementations integrating external services via typed APIs |
| [cli](./cli/)           | Main command line interface and subcommand implementations |
| [core](./core/)         | Core engine components, exception hierarchies, and pipeline execution logic |
| [data](./data/)         | Data files for the package |
| [net](./net/)           | Networking layer for distributed pipeline execution, including brokers, clients, workers, and transports |
| [utils](./utils/)       | Utility helpers, including local runner classes to invoke the engine easily |

## Onboarding Approach

New developers should start by understanding the architectural layers and
responsibilities:

1. Familiarize with the design and patterns in the core engine (`core/`),
   including pipeline processing, variable management, and exception
   handling.

2. Understand how the CLI (`cli/`) orchestrates command parsing and execution
   by delegating to specific command classes.

3. Study the asynchronous command and service integration abstractions in
   `chipsets/`, focusing on the Registry pattern for dynamic command dispatch,
   external API interfacing, and error mapping.

4. Explore the distributed networking layer in `net/` to grasp communication
   protocols, client-worker-broker roles, multiplexed async execution flow,
   and transport abstractions.

5. Peruse the data files in `data/` to get an understanding of additional
   files installed by the package,

6. Utilize the utility interfaces in `utils/` — particularly the `LocalRunner`
   — to gain hands-on experience running pipelines locally before moving to
   distributed and integrated scenarios.

Developers should have strong knowledge of Python async programming, data
modeling with Pydantic, exception handling hierarchy design, distributed system
concepts, and pipeline orchestration.

## Design Notes

- The project employs asynchronous programming patterns extensively, including
  async-await coroutines, multiplexed task execution, and non-blocking network I/O.

- Command and chipset components follow the Command design pattern with typed
  input/output models and centralized dynamic completion via registries.

- The networking layer uses a modular transport abstraction supporting multiple
  protocols with uniform packet and message semantics.

- Exceptions are well-structured and classified by processing stage for
  precise error reporting and control flow.

- The overall structure promotes separation of concerns, extensibility, and
  reuse of core engine facilities across CLI, networked, and utility
  components.

This README serves as the foundational documentation for the ReasonChip project
structure and is intended for developers onboarding to the codebase for
feature work or maintenance.
