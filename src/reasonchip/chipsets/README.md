# Chipsets

## Overview

This directory contains various ReasonChip chipsets that provide 
pluggable command implementations for external service integrations and 
common utility functionalities. The chipsets are asynchronous and 
structured around Pydantic request-response models with error handling.

## Filesystem Overview

| Location               | Description                                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| [http.py](./http.py)           | HTTP client chipset using `httpx.AsyncClient` for asynchronous HTTP requests. |
| [redis.py](./redis.py)         | Redis command chipset wrapping redis-py async client for dynamic Redis command execution. |
| [telegram.py](./telegram.py)   | Telegram Bot API sending chipset for async message/media sending via Telegram bots. |
| [reasonchip/](./reasonchip/)   | Core async, logging, and stream handling components for ReasonChip internal services. |
| [reasoning/](./reasoning/)     | Reasoning chipsets implementing external AI and reasoning API integrations. |
| [utils/](./utils/)             | Utility chipsets with common asynchronous helper commands (e.g., JSON, strings, time). |

## Onboarding Approach

1. Understand ReasonChip's async command architecture based on request-
   response patterns implemented via Pydantic models and asynchronous 
   functions.

2. Familiarize with the `Registry.register` decorator that exposes 
   chipset functions as dynamically invocable ReasonChip commands.

3. Start with utility chipsets in `utils/` to grasp simple asynchronous 
   command patterns, including error handling and response status semantics.

4. Review `http.py`, `redis.py`, and `telegram.py` for examples of 
   external service integration chipsets. Observe dynamic method invocation, 
   error categorization, and client configuration via input models.

5. Study the core `reasonchip/` components for infrastructure around
   async task handling, logging, and I/O streaming.

6. Explore `reasoning/` for advanced reasoning and AI service integrations,
   noting patterns of external API client configuration, request orchestration,
   and typed structured results.

7. Have strong proficiency in Python async programming (`async`/`await`), 
   Pydantic for typed data models, and general patterns of error and resource management.

## Design Notes

- The chipsets implement the Command pattern with distinct request and 
  response models for clean interface boundaries.

- All commands are asynchronous, enabling non-blocking IO with services 
  such as HTTP, Redis, and Telegram.

- The Registry pattern is employed for dynamic registration and discovery 
  of chipset commands within ReasonChip.

- The defensive error handling maps external library exceptions into defined 
  status codes for standardization.

- Dynamic method dispatch allows flexible usage of client libraries 
  while preserving type safety at the boundary via models.

- The directory promotes modularity and separation of concerns, splitting 
  reasoning, utility, core infra, and protocol chipsets into distinct 
  namespaces.

This structure supports extensible and maintainable integration 
command implementations for the ReasonChip framework.
