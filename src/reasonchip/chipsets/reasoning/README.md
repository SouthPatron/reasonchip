# Reasoning Chipsets

## Overview

This directory hosts the core reasoning chipsets for the ReasonChip
framework. Reasoning chipsets encapsulate logic for AI-powered reasoning
and natural language processing tasks by integrating with external
APIs or implementing reasoning algorithms.

Subdirectories implement concrete reasoning capabilities or
service integrations such as OpenAI chat completion.

## Filesystem Overview

| Location   | Description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| [openai/](./openai/) | Integration with OpenAI's Chat Completion API, including
client configuration, request/response models, and async API calls. |

## Onboarding Approach

To effectively onboard and understand these reasoning chipsets:

1. Study ReasonChip's chipset architecture, focusing on how reasoning
   tasks are delegated and managed.

2. Examine `openai/` as a representative implementation involving
   asynchronous calls to external AI services.

3. Understand Pydantic models used extensively for request, client
   configuration, and response validation.

4. Learn the async programming model used for non-blocking API
   integration and network error management.

5. Review error classification schemes that distinguish API errors,
   connection errors, and rate limits.

6. Comprehend how chipset functions take typed requests and return
   typed responses encapsulating status and results.

## Design Notes

- Reasoning chipsets serve as adaptors between ReasonChip and external
  or internal reasoning engines.

- Chipsets separate concerns of configuration, request construction,
  API invocation, and response processing.

- Error handling is explicit and categorized for downstream awareness.

- Pydantic underpins data validation, enforcing type safety and request
  consistency.

- The directory structure enforces modular development and clear code
  ownership per reasoning capability.

## Dependencies

- Python async features for concurrency-safe external API calls.
- Pydantic for structured data models and validation.
- ReasonChip core components for chipset registration and management.

This layered and modular design enables scalable, maintainable, and
robust reasoning integrations within ReasonChip.
