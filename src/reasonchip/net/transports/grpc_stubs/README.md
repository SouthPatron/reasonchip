# gRPC Stubs

## Overview

This directory contains the gRPC stub code auto-generated from the
ReasonChip protobuf definitions. These stubs include the protobuf
message classes and gRPC client and server classes that facilitate
communication over gRPC.

## Filesystem Overview

| Location                         | Description                                   |
| --------------------------------| ---------------------------------------------|
| [reasonchip_pb2.py](./reasonchip_pb2.py)       | Protobuf generated classes for messages defined in reasonchip.proto |
| [reasonchip_pb2_grpc.py](./reasonchip_pb2_grpc.py) | gRPC service classes and client/server stub implementations auto-generated from protobuf service definitions |

## Details

- `reasonchip_pb2.py` contains the protobuf message definitions
  for `UUID` and `ReasonChipPacket`, generated by the protobuf
  compiler. This file should not be edited manually.

- `reasonchip_pb2_grpc.py` provides the gRPC stub classes:

  - `ReasonChipServiceStub` implements the client-side interface
    with the `EstablishConnection` bidirectional streaming RPC.

  - `ReasonChipServiceServicer` defines the server-side interface
    that must be subclassed and the `EstablishConnection` method
    overridden to handle client streams.

  - `add_ReasonChipServiceServicer_to_server` is a helper to register
    service implementations with a gRPC server.

  - An experimental `ReasonChipService` class provides an alternative
    API for establishing streaming RPC connections.

- Version compatibility checks warn and fail if the gRPC runtime 
  version does not meet the minimum required version for these 
  stubs (grpcio>=1.68.1).

- These files are generated; any changes must be made on the
  protobuf `.proto` definition files, then regenerated.

- The `__init__.py` is blank except for licensing and serves to define
  the directory as a Python package.

Use these stubs to implement ReasonChip clients and servers
communicating over gRPC.
