		For the first time in history, general intelligence and adaptive
		reasoning have become a commodity which can be automated at scale.

		Our goal is to build the open source tools for everyone to use within
		their environment for AI deployment, integration, and automation
		without them needing to develop their own AI architecture.

		Just as people have a choice of open source databases for their
		infrastructure, we want to provide the same for reasoning. We want to
		be one of the options.
