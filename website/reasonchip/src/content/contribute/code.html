		Do you want a new feature?
	</p>

	<p>
		Depending on the size, relevance, and manpower required to implement it,
		it may be added to the roadmap. Please submit it as an
		<a
			target="_blank"
			href="https://github.com/SouthPatron/reasonchip/issues"
			>issue</a> so I can check it out.
		Preferably, please provide a detailed-enough description of the feature.

		Depending on the level of sponsorship I have, I may need financial

<div class="p-3">
	<p>
	<span class="lead">Yes! Absolutely! The more, the better.</span>
	</p>

	<p>
	You actually have two choices:
	<ul>
		<li>
			You can provide a PyPI package which people can just install and
			use of your own accord;
		</li>
		<li>
			You can submit your chip for inclusion into the reasonchip package
			and that means that:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Your chip will be available to anyone who installed
					reasonchip, obviously;
				</li>
				<li>
					Your chip documentation will be available on the official
					website with the increased visibility and exposure.
				</li>
				<li>
					In the case of issues, I'll bounce them back to you
					to sort out.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
	In order of prefence of submitters:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Official software integrations from the target software. ie:
			"VendorChip" from original "Vendor Inc."
		</li>
		<li>
			Definitely not least, anyone else who provides a good solution.
		</li>
	</ul>
