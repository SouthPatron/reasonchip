	<p>
		If you have(or are) a commercial user and your lawyers don't want to
		include GPLv3 code in your system, you can purchase a commercial license.
		That will go a long way to support me and my work. Please just
		bare in mind that you don't need a commercial license for commercial
		use of the ReasonChip code if you comply with the GPLv3 license. Most
		people don't need one.
