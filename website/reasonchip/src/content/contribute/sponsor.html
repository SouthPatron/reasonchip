	I know this all looks super-professional (and I like to think that it is),
	but it's just me right now and I'm funding this all on my own.
	</p>

	<p>
	As stated on the goal page, I'm here to build the internal AI
	infrastructure tools and software which you will use within your
	own projects and companies so that you don't have to. You can focus
	on your business problem.
	</p>

	<p>
		Right now, I have one sponsorship channel:<br/>

	</p>

	<p>
		Anything, absolutely anything, helps and is greatly appreciated more
		than I can express.
	</p>

	<p>
		I love toolsmithing and coding. It's all I want
		to do; it's all I've ever done. This is my attempt to create my own
		job, then business, then become one of the lead AI and dynamic open
		source providers in use ... until the singularity. After that, my job
		is done.
