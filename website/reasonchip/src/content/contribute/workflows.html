		and exposure.</span>

	<p>
		If you have a really good (or cool) example which you would like
		included, please submit a <a
			target="_blank"
			href="https://github.com/SouthPatron/reasonchip/">
			pull request</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For everything else, please expose them yourself to your
		users or clients.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are several reasons why you would want to provide a workflow
		for general consumption.
	</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Clarity</strong> – Developers can understand exactly how the system behaves.</li>
	  <li><strong>Debugging</strong> – It’s easier to trace issues or pinpoint failures.</li>
	  <li><strong>Integration</strong> – Clear workflows help developers connect external systems reliably.</li>
	  <li><strong>Planning</strong> – They can align their own tools or schedules with the system’s behavior.</li>
	  <li><strong>Trust</strong> – Transparency in logic builds confidence in the system’s output.</li>
	  <li><strong>Feedback</strong> – Developers can provide precise input when they see the actual flow.</li>
	  <li><strong>Up-to-date understanding</strong> – Live workflows serve as accurate, self-documenting references.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		That's a bit of marketing-speak but you get the idea.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can provide intelligent integration into your systems which
		users may run on their side.
	</p>
