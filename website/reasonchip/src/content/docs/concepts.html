</h3>

<div class="p-3">
	<p>
	ReasonChip is a modular framework for automating complex intellectual labor
	through declarative pipelines and dynamic execution units called
	<strong>Chips</strong>. Its architecture is designed to be scalable,
	distributed, and developer-friendly, making it ideal for building advanced
	reasoning systems, automation tools, and smart agents.
	</p>

<i class="text-success me-3 bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i> Workflows
</h3>

<div class="p-3">
	<p>
	  A <strong>workflow</strong> is the execution of one or more pipelines -
	  moving step by step through a reasoning or automation process. Workflows
	  are top-down and sequential by default, but can branch, pause, restart,
	  or cancel based on logic defined in the pipeline. They can span multiple
	  pipelines and respond dynamically to real-time results.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A <strong>pipeline</strong> is a YAML-defined sequence of tasks that express how work is carried out.
	  Pipelines are clean, configurable, and declarative, removing the need for orchestration code.
	  They support conditional logic, branching, sidequests, async tasks, and more.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A <strong>task</strong> is a single step in a pipeline. It is used to 
	  call chips to perform the function of the task.
	</p>

	<p>
	  A <strong>Chip</strong> is an async Python function that performs a focused taskâ€”such as sending a message, making a decision, or calling an API.
	  Chips are registered using <code>@Registry.register</code> and are discoverable by pipelines.
	  Each Chip uses Pydantic for structured input/output validation and can be composed into larger workflows.
	</p>

<i class="text-success me-3 bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i> System Architecture
</h3>

<div class="p-3">
	<p>
	  ReasonChip operates as a distributed system composed of three roles:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Clients:</strong> Submit workflows and receive results</li>
	  <li><strong>Brokers:</strong> Manage execution flow and dispatch tasks to workers</li>
	  <li><strong>Workers:</strong> Run chips and return results, logs, or intermediate states</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This architecture supports secure, scalable execution locally or across
	cloud environments.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="px-4 py-2 bg-success-subtle border shadow">
<i class="text-success me-3 bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i> Developer Experience
</h3>

<div class="p-3">
	<p>
	  Developers using ReasonChip focus on logic - not orchestration. They:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Write async Chips with validated input/output</li>
	  <li>Register Chips with the system for dynamic execution</li>
	  <li>Compose pipelines in YAML to model reasoning and automation</li>
	  <li>Debug workflows via streaming logs and result tracking</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="px-4 py-2 bg-success-subtle border shadow">
<i class="text-success me-3 bi bi-arrow-right-square-fill"></i> Why ReasonChip?
</h3>
<div class="p-3">
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Modular:</strong> Reuse small Chips across many workflows</li>
	  <li><strong>Declarative:</strong> Define what should happen, not how</li>
	  <li><strong>Async-native:</strong> Designed for concurrency and responsiveness</li>
	  <li><strong>Composable:</strong> Easily build intelligent systems from simple parts</li>
	</ul>
