<div class="p-3">
	<p>
	A workflow is a structured execution of logical steps, defined
	as a sequence of modular tasks which call chips, orchestrated within a
	declarative pipeline.
	</p>
	<p>Each workflow represents a segment of intellectual
	labor - such as decision-making, analysis, or automation - broken down into
	reusable, well-defined operations.
	</p>
	<p>These workflows are described in YAML, executed top-down unless
	redirected by flow controls (like branching or sidequests), and can
	span across multiple pipelines for complex or multi-phase reasoning.
	</p>
	<p>By combining dynamic execution, asynchronous	processing, and real-time
	feedback, workflows enable scalable, intelligent automation of
	thought-driven processes.

	<h4>Pipeline</h4>
	<p>
		A <strong>pipeline</strong> is a declaratively defined sequence of
		tasks, written in YAML. It models a segment of intellectual work â€” such
		as a decision-making process, reasoning chain, or task automation
		flow. Pipelines are:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Executed top-down unless flow is redirected</li>
	<li>Composed of well-defined tasks</li>
	<li>Parameterizable, observable, and interruptible</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="p-3">
	<h3>Task</h3>
	<p>
		A <strong>task</strong> is a step within a pipeline. It maps directly
		to a chip invocation and supports fields like:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><code>name</code>: Human-readable identifier</li>
	<li><code>method_name</code>: Fully qualified chip name</li>
	<li><code>params</code>: Input arguments for the chip</li>
	<li>Optional: <code>log</code>, <code>save_as</code>, <code>async_as</code>, <code>when</code></li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="p-3">
	<h4>Chip</h4>
	<p>
	A <strong>Chip</strong> is the atomic unit of work in ReasonChip. It
	performs a single, well-defined action (e.g., sending a message, running
	a query, making an API call). Each chip is:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>An <code>async</code> Python function</li>
	<li>Accepts and returns Pydantic models</li>
	<li>Registered with the system via <code>@Registry.register</code></li>
	<li>Discoverable and reusable within pipelines</li>
	</ul>
</div>

		ReasonChip pipelines support advanced control patterns:

	<ul>
	<li><strong>Branching</strong>: Jump to a new pipeline</li>
	<li><strong>Sidequest</strong>: Run a sub-pipeline and return</li>
	<li><strong>Restart</strong> / <strong>Stop</strong> / <strong>Cancel</strong>: Control execution flow programmatically</li>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Chip provides a structured approach to automating intellectual labor
through the use of <strong>Chips</strong> and <strong>Pipelines</strong>.
This document outlines the core concepts behind Chip and its
functionality.</p>

<h2>Core Concepts</h2>

<h3>Chip</h3>
<p>A <strong>Chip</strong> is an individual computational unit that performs
a specific action. It serves as a fundamental building block in a pipeline,
handling discrete tasks that contribute to a broader reasoning or
decision-making process.</p>

<h3>Pipeline</h3>
<p>A <strong>pipeline</strong> is an ordered sequence of Chips designed to
accomplish a segment of intellectual labor. It allows for the modular
execution of reasoning tasks, ensuring scalability and reusability.</p>

<p>A pipeline is entered at the top and run through in sequence unless
execution is explicitly stopped.</p>

<h3>Collection of Pipelines</h3>
<p>Multiple pipeline definitions (YAML files) are collectively referred
to as a <strong>collection of pipelines</strong>. This allows for
structured execution across multiple workflow definitions.</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>A <strong>task</strong> represents a call to a Chip within a pipeline.
Each task consists of:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>name</strong>: A human-readable identifier for the task.</li>
	<li><strong>log</strong>: (Optional) A message to be logged before execution.</li>
	<li><strong>method_name</strong>: The name of the Chip method being executed.</li>
	<li><strong>params</strong>: The parameters required for the method execution.</li>
	<li><strong>save_as</strong>: (Optional) A variable name to store the result of the task.</li>
	<li><strong>async_as</strong>: (Optional) If defined, the task is executed asynchronously and the pipeline continues.</li>
	<li><strong>when</strong>: (Optional) A conditional statement that determines if the task should run.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pipeline Definition</h2>
<p>Pipelines are defined using YAML, allowing for easy configuration and
execution of tasks.</p>

<h3>Example Task Definition</h3>
<pre><code>- name: 'Say hello'
  log: 'Saying hello'
  reasonchip.debug.log:
    level: info
    msg: exit
</code></pre>

<h3>Explanation</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The task is named <strong>'Say hello'</strong>.</li>
	<li>A log message is specified: <strong>'Saying hello'</strong>.</li>
	<li>The method <strong>chip.debug.log</strong> is invoked with the parameters:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>level</strong> set to <code>info</code></li>
		<li><strong>msg</strong> set to <code>exit</code></li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>This structure ensures that each task within a pipeline is well-defined,
self-contained, and easily readable.</p>

<h2>Branching and Execution Control</h2>
<p>Pipelines provide mechanisms for controlling execution flow:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Branching</strong> - All remaining tasks and pipelines are cancelled, and the target pipeline is started as requested.</li>
	<li><strong>Sidequest</strong> - A new pipeline is executed immediately, and upon completion, the current pipeline resumes at the next task.</li>
	<li><strong>Cancelling</strong> - The current pipeline is cancelled, and execution returns to the beginning of the sidequest. If no sidequest remains, the pipeline terminates.</li>
	<li><strong>Restart</strong> - The current pipeline restarts from the beginning.</li>
	<li><strong>Stop</strong> - The entire execution job terminates immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Chip enables structured execution of reasoning tasks through its modular
and pipeline-based approach. By defining pipelines using YAML and enforcing
structured task definitions, it provides a scalable and efficient framework
for automating intellectual labor.</p>
